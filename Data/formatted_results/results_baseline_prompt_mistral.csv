"TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE. I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses. Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a""creative"" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.

The text suggests a series of hypothetical events that might lead to an extreme outcome (starting a character at level 68, then 90, then a ""creative"" mode with all items), implying that each step is a logical extension of the previous one. However, this is not necessarily true, and the sequence is used to dismiss the idea of an adventure mode without providing a solid argument against it. This is a Slippery Slope fallacy."

"," [{""text"": ""It's exactly the same as smurfing."", ""class"": ""False Equivalence""}]

Explanation: The author equates having an ""alt"" account with smurfing, but the two concepts are not exactly the same. While smurfing refers to creating a new account to play with lower-ranked players or for other dishonest purposes, having an ""alt"" account is typically used for legitimate reasons, such as playing with friends who are of a higher rank. Therefore, the author is making a false equivalence by stating that they are the same thing."

Explanation:

1. ""NOBODY WANTS ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS ANYMORE."" is a hasty generalization because it claims that no one wants establishment politicians, but it doesn't provide any evidence or data to support this claim.

2. ""Like Jesus Christ you think they would learn."" is an ad-hominem fallacy because it attacks the person (implies that the person thinks like Jesus Christ, which is not relevant to the argument) rather than addressing the argument itself."

Explanation: The speaker suggests that because the leaders of the time are ruthless and fanatical, America must move forward in every area. This implies that if they don't, things will get worse. This is an example of the Slippery Slope fallacy, where a small step is presented as leading inevitably to a chain of related events, often negative, without sufficient reason to believe that this is the case."

Explanation: The fallacy in this statement is known as the Prediction Fallacy or the Inductive Fallacy. This fallacy occurs when a specific event is inferred to be a reliable indicator of a future event, without sufficient evidence to support that inference. In this case, the inference is made that the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election, based on the past result, but this does not necessarily hold true in the future."

Explanation: The text implies that because there are important issues in the world, focusing on a video game port request is not worth the time, implying that the person who started the petition is trivializing important issues. However, the intention of the text is not to attack a specific person, but rather to question the importance of the petition, which is a common characteristic of the Ad Hominem fallacy. The text does not explicitly mention a person, but the implication is there."
"Carbon dioxide hurts nobody' s health. It' s good for plants. Climate change need not endanger anyone.
"," [{""text"": ""Carbon dioxide hurts nobody' s health. It' s good for plants."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

Explanation: The fallacy of False Dichotomy is committed when only two options are presented, and a situation is more complex than those two options. In this case, the text implies that the only two outcomes of carbon dioxide are either it doesn't affect human health or it's beneficial for plants. However, the real impact of carbon dioxide on human health is more nuanced, and it can have both positive and negative effects depending on the concentration levels."
"Mr. Governor issues a proclamation for the people of his state to pray for rain. Several months later, it rains. Praise the gods!

Explanation: The text suggests a causal relationship between the proclamation for prayer and the subsequent rain, implying that the prayer directly caused the rain. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and the occurrence of rain could be due to many other factors, such as natural weather patterns, not just the prayer. This is a causal fallacy because it oversimplifies or misrepresents the causal relationship between events."

Explanation: The speaker is making a broad assumption about the future state of New York based on limited information, without sufficient evidence to support their claim that the infection rate will start again when lockdown ends.

[{""text"": ""You cant stop nature. You're going to be infected if you havent already. We are always trying to fight nature. We just have to let it run its course."", ""class"": ""oversimplification""}]

Explanation: The speaker oversimplifies the complex issue of the coronavirus pandemic by reducing it to a simple battle between humans and nature, implying that humans cannot control the spread of the virus and should instead accept its course. This oversimplification ignores the role of human actions and public health measures in controlling the spread of the virus."

"," [{""text"": ""Jeff tells his superiors that grape is the flavor favored most by high school students."", ""class"": ""selection-bias""}]

Explanation:
The fallacy here is Selection Bias. Jeff has only surveyed students in an English class, which may not be representative of all high school students' beverage preferences. By not considering other demographics or contexts, he has biased the results towards grape-flavored drinks. This could lead to an incorrect conclusion that grape is the most preferred flavor among all high school students."

This is law school arrogance at its finest. Why not a brain surgeon?
"," [{""text"": ""Why not a brain surgeon?"", ""class"": ""False Analogy""}]

Explanation: The text contains a false analogy fallacy. The author is comparing two different professions (law and brain surgery) to suggest that a law degree is not suitable for finance. However, the two professions are not analogous, as they require different skill sets and knowledge bases. This comparison is used to make an extreme or unreasonable claim, which is not logically sound."
"The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin' s gain.

"," [{""text"": ""The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin' s gain."", ""class"": ""Slippery slope""}]

Explanation: The text suggests that the loss of sea ice is solely beneficial for President Vladimir Putin, implying that there are no other negative consequences of this loss.

Explanation: The fallacy of Ad Hominem occurs when someone attacks the character, motive, or other attribute of a person instead of attacking their argument. In this case, Jaylen is not addressing Brandon's argument about having tastier lunches but instead discrediting him as a ""terrible person"" based on unrelated actions."

The text is making a broad, sweeping statement about two large groups of people (Christians and Muslims) based on a limited example (the incident with the bar in Thurles). This is a hasty generalization because it oversimplifies complex issues and fails to consider individual differences within these groups.

Additionally, the text seems to imply a comparison between the reactions of these two groups to offensive advertisements, but it does not provide any evidence or specific examples to support this comparison, which is another form of a logical fallacy known as ""Comparing Apples to Oranges"" or ""Unequal Comparison."" However, this fallacy is not as clear-cut in this case as the Hasty Generalization, as it is more of an inference drawn from the text rather than an explicit statement."

"," [{""text"": ""If he sold big amounts at 6k, he tried to bring the price even lower and cause a total sell off."", ""class"": ""slippery slope""}]

Explanation: The author assumes that selling a large amount of Bitcoin at a low price automatically leads to a further drop in the price (total sell-off) and this is not necessarily true. The author's argument is based on the assumption that the action of one individual can have a significant impact on the entire market, which is a slippery slope fallacy as it oversimplifies complex systems and assumes a direct, linear relationship between actions and outcomes."

Looks like the exception is charging to the rescue of the norm. Plot twist!"", ""class"": ""strawman""}]

Explanation:
The author presents a strawman argument by misrepresenting the far-left position as believing that behavior is solely a social construct determined by toys. This oversimplification and misrepresentation of the far-left position allows the author to attack a weaker version of the position, rather than the actual position, which is more nuanced and complex. The author's argument implies that the far-left must now accept that there are differences between the brains of men and women, but this is not the primary focus of the far-left or the study in question. The author is using this argument to further their own narrative, rather than engaging in a fair and accurate debate on the topic at hand."

"," [{""text"": ""What precisely makes these world leaders so convinced that climate change is a more urgent and massive threat than the incessant rampages of Islamist violence?"", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The fallacy of False Dilemma occurs when only two options are presented as the only possible solutions, when in reality there are other options or factors at play. In this case, the text suggests that either climate change or terrorism can be the main concern for world leaders, implying that they cannot address both issues at the same time. However, it is possible for world leaders to prioritize multiple issues, and they may perceive climate change as a more urgent and massive threat due to a variety of factors, not just the rate of temperature increase.

Additionally, the text implies that the slow increase in world temperatures disproves the urgency of addressing climate change, which is a form of the Appeal to Ignorance fallacy. This fallacy occurs when a claim is based on the supposed lack of evidence for the opposite claim, rather than providing evidence for the claim itself. In this case, the text suggests that the slow increase in world temperatures disproves the urgency of addressing climate change, without providing evidence that the urgency of addressing terrorism is greater.

Finally, the text implies that the scientific consensus in 1990 was incorrect in predicting the rate of temperature increase, which is a form of the Ad Hominem fallacy. This fallacy occurs when an argument is invalidated based on a personal attack on the opponent or the source of the argument, rather than addressing the argument itself. In this case, the text implies that the scientists who predicted the rate of temperature increase were incorrect, without providing evidence to support this claim.

Overall, the text contains the fallacies of False Dilemma, Appeal to Ignorance, and Ad Hominem."

Explanation: The speaker suggests that their response to the bombing will be to find the source of the attack and retaliate, but they will not just kill people indiscriminately as a form of revenge (i.e., ""We're not going to simply kill some people to say, 'Oh, look, we got even.'""). However, they imply that their response will be a slippery slope, where the act of retaliation could lead to an escalation of violence. This is a slippery slope fallacy because it oversimplifies a complex situation and implies that one action inevitably leads to another without considering other possible outcomes or solutions."

Explanation: The text presents a series of statements, but the conclusion (""So I really don't think so."") does not logically follow from the premises. The text suggests a comparison between tools used against terrorists, drug dealers, and white-collar criminals, but it does not provide a logical reason to doubt the initial claim that actions against terrorists require court orders and scrutiny."

The text contains two logical fallacies: False Cause and Hasty Generalization.

- The Hasty Generalization fallacy occurs in the sentences ""So as we can easily gather, every form of government had its share of shitty figureheads. That doesn't prove anything.""

The post suggests that because humans might have died out if they only ate vegetables, it's reasonable to eat meat. This is a slippery slope fallacy, as it oversimplifies the complexities of human evolution and diet, and assumes that the only possible alternative to meat consumption is a vegetarian diet, which is not the case.

The text oversimplifies the motives of the Florida officer by suggesting only two possible reasons for his actions: personal gain or psychopathy. This oversimplification ignores the complexity of human behavior and the multitude of factors that could contribute to someone's actions. Additionally, the text makes a strong judgment about the officer's character, labeling him as an ""asshole"" and a ""psychopath,"" without evidence or context.

The text presents a sequence of increasingly severe consequences as a result of gambling, implying that these consequences are inevitable. This is a logical fallacy known as the Slippery Slope, where a minor premise is linked to a series of increasingly extreme consequences, suggesting that the minor premise leads inexorably to the extreme consequences. In reality, the connection between starting to gamble and turning to crime is not necessarily causal, and there may be other factors at play."

Explanation: The text suggests that if the ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity) is low (1), it's not worth taking action against greenhouse gas emissions. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if ECS is low, it's not a problem that requires action. This is a slippery slope fallacy because it oversimplifies the issue by presenting a direct correlation between ECS and the importance of taking action against greenhouse gas emissions, when in reality, the situation is more complex."

1. ""This has got to be the strangest thing I have came across."" - This statement is an example of hyperbole, which is an exaggeration used for emphasis or effect.
2. ""From a practicing judge?"" - This question is an example of an appeal to authority, where the argument is that because the speaker is a practicing judge, their opinion is more valid or reliable. However, this is a fallacious use of authority because the judge's position does not make their opinion on the validity of the story more accurate. The truth or falsehood of the story does not depend on the speaker's profession, but on the evidence presented."

The fallacy of False Dilemma is committed when a situation is presented with only two options, but one or both of these options are oversimplified or one or both are invalid. In this case, the post implies that one should either be upset about someone else's luck or be thankful for not being in worse circumstances. This oversimplifies the range of possible feelings and responses a person might have.

The other statements in the post do not necessarily constitute logical fallacies, but rather express opinions or generalizations.

This is an Appeal to Numbers fallacy, where data is presented without proper context or methodology, making it potentially misleading.

The author's claim might not be false, but the way it is presented can lead the reader to draw an incorrect conclusion.

Also, the text contains an implicit comparison between the current situation and the time of President Kennedy, but no clear basis for this comparison is provided, which can be considered a fallacy of ambiguity or equivocation. However, this fallacy is not as explicit as the Misleading Vividness fallacy, and its presence is more subjective.

Therefore, the text contains at least one fallacy, Misleading Vividness, and potentially another, fallacy of ambiguity or equivocation."

Explanation: The author is attacking the individual (Trump) personally rather than addressing the argument or idea. This is an ad hominem fallacy. The author is implying that because Trump's personal actions or character are bad, his healthcare plan must be bad, which is not a logical conclusion. The focus should be on the merits of the plan itself, not the person proposing it."

Explanation: This text is a chain of hypothetical events, each event leading to the next, and it is used to illustrate the importance of seemingly insignificant actions. However, it is not a logical fallacy, but rather a form of reasoning called hypothetical deduction. The text does not make an unjustified assumption, draw a false conclusion, or ignore relevant information, which are characteristics of logical fallacies.

The fallacy in this text is known as ""false cause.""

The author is basing their argument against hunting on their personal belief that they went vegetarian because of factory farming, which is an unnatural practice. This is an example of the Appeal to Personal Belief fallacy, where an argument is based on the personal experiences, beliefs, or opinions of the author, rather than on evidence or rational argument.

The author is using an analogy to compare eating meat to art forms like classical music, theater, or sculpture, implying that they are equivalent. However, this comparison is not necessarily valid as the two subjects have different moral, ethical, and practical implications. This is a fallacy of analogy, as the reasoning is based on an inappropriate or misleading comparison."

Explanation: The text implies an equivalence between two different situations (Bush's administration and Obama's administration) without acknowledging or stating the key differences between them. This is a form of the logical fallacy known as False Equivalence. The text suggests that the size of the deficits is the only relevant factor, ignoring other important factors such as the causes, context, or policies that might have contributed to the deficits."

Explanation: The speaker implies that because Henry Kissinger (the Secretary of State under President Nixon) was responsible for the foreign policy, the Republican administration's foreign policy is good, which is a false cause fallacy.

The statement ""alex jones is cuckoo bananas"" is a personal attack on Alex Jones, rather than addressing the ideas or actions he promotes, which is the definition of the Ad Hominem fallacy.

The phrase ""he thinks he's just hanging out with a buddy but what he fails to realize is that he has a huge platform with a fan base of highly impressionable young men who feel wronged by society and entitled to scream like a monkey on the back of a pig with a cowboy hat"" implies that Joe Organ is responsible for the actions and beliefs of his followers, which is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the relationship between a speaker and their audience, often referred to as the Bandwagon fallacy. However, the text does not explicitly state that ""Free speech bad"" is a cause or a result of Joe Organ's actions, so it's not a direct Bandwagon fallacy. Instead, it's more of a general statement that could be interpreted as a Bandwagon argument.

Therefore, the text contains an Ad Hominem fallacy and a possible Bandwagon fallacy."

Explanation: The text implies that because humans have used substances that could be considered recreational drugs since the development of agriculture, it is a universal behavior among all humans. This is a hasty generalization, as it assumes the behavior of a large group (all humans) based on the behavior of a smaller, non-representative subset (certain ancient societies)."

"," [{""text"": ""Since he skipped one class, he will start skipping more frequently. Then he will drop out altogether, never graduate or get into college, and end up unemployed and living at home for the rest of his life."", ""class"": ""Slippery Slope""}]

The text makes a logical leap from the action of skipping one class to a series of increasingly severe consequences, implying that these consequences are inevitable. This is a Slippery Slope fallacy, as it oversimplifies the complex relationship between actions and outcomes.

The text is using the slippery slope fallacy by implying that a series of actions or events are connected in such a way that each step is a small deviation from the previous one, and that this series of small deviations will inevitably lead to a disastrous or extreme outcome. In this case, the author is suggesting that allowing a small extension of store hours (10 minutes) will lead to increasingly longer extensions, and ultimately, chaos. However, the connection between these actions is not necessarily logical or inevitable, and the author is using this connection to manipulate the reader's emotions or beliefs."

Explanation: The fallacy of False Dilemma occurs when only two options are presented as the only possible alternatives, while there may be other options available.

The author suggests that the repair will require an expensive kit, but also offers an alternative of borrowing one, implying that not having the expensive kit would make the repair impossible. This is a slippery slope fallacy, as it exaggerates the consequences of not having the expensive kit, making the repair seem more difficult than it actually might be."

POST: Is the color really obvious? I prefer non tint"," [{""text"": ""Is the color really obvious? I prefer non tint"", ""class"": ""Begging the Question""}]

Explanation: The fallacy ""Begging the Question"" (also known as ""Circular Argument"") occurs when an argument assumes what it is supposed to prove. In this case, the statement ""Is the color really obvious?"" assumes that the color is obvious, which is what the person is asking about. The assumption is that the color is obvious because the person prefers non-tinted products, but this preference doesn't necessarily mean that the tinted product's color is obvious to everyone."

Explanation:
- The text ""Dog software on cat hardware"" is an analogy, but it's not comparing in a way that makes sense or is reasonable, which is a common flaw in analogies.
- The text ""Wouldn't it be the other way around?"" is a Reverse-Error, as it assumes that because the Firefox update (software) is being compared to a dog, the hardware (browser) should be compared to a cat, but this contradicts the initial analogy."

Explanation: The speaker is suggesting that their personal rule not to joke about parents dying is due to their work with orphans, implying that their work has negatively affected their empathy, which is a slippery slope fallacy.

Explanation: The post is making a personal attack on the individual based on their sexual orientation, which is irrelevant to the topic of the story. This is an example of the Ad Hominem fallacy, where arguments are made against a person rather than the topic at hand.

[{""text"": ""Its not necessary for the story but it certainly enhances it."", ""class"": ""Irrelevant Detail""}]

POST: I almost forgot about Dre"," [{""text"": ""I nearly forgot about Dre"", ""class"": ""Slip of the Tongue""}]

The fallacy identified here is Slip of the Tongue. This is not a logical fallacy per se, but it is a type of error that can lead to misleading or confusing statements. In this case, the author mentions Dr. Dre first and then Michael, but then seems to forget Dr. Dre and starts a new sentence about him. This can be confusing to the reader as it suggests that the author was thinking about Michael instead of Dr. Dre. However, the author later mentions Dr. Dre again, which shows that the slip of the tongue was not a serious lapse in reasoning.

The other sentences in the text do not contain any logical fallacies."
"TITLE: Why is there so much turmoil towards the pharmaceutical industry among the general public ? And do professionals in this field feel the same way about the field ?
POST: It's an industry like any other. The outrage is mostly aimed at outrageous pricing for their products *in America*. That's not the fault of that industry at the core, it's the fault of a political system allowing it. We don't suffer from that where I live, and we get our medicine from the same industry. And you have to keep one thing in mind, development of medications is brutally expensive. That leads to another problem. The industry wants to make profit, and consequently directs their efforts at products that will sell well. Medication for rare conditions will never recoup the development cost and consequently don't get researched. That's another systemic problem.

That's not the fault of that industry at the core, it's the fault of a political system allowing it."", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The author presents two extreme positions (the pharmaceutical industry or the political system) and suggests that one is to blame for the outrageous pricing, implying that only one of these can be the cause. However, it's possible that both the industry and the political system contribute to the issue, and the author's argument oversimplifies the complexity of the problem.

[{""text"": ""Many people have been calling out science subreddit mods like mvea etc for spamming'shill articles' etc. And I've begun to question it myself after seeing so many clickbait articles around on r/science. Are those claims true?"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

The author uses the opinions of many people and their own questioning as evidence that the claims made by those who call out the science subreddit mods may not be true. However, this is an appeal to popularity, which is a fallacy as the truth of a claim is not determined by how many people believe it or how popular it is.

[{""text"": ""We don't suffer from that where I live, and we get our medicine from the same industry."", ""class"": ""False Cause""}]

The author suggests that because they do not experience the same issues with the pharmaceutical industry where they live, it means that the problems are not caused by the industry, but rather by the political system. This is a fallacy because correlation does not imply causation. The author's personal experience in a different location does not prove that the problems are not caused by the industry.

[{""text"": ""Medication for rare conditions will never recoup the development cost and consequently don't get researched."", ""class"": ""Slippery Slope""}]

The author suggests that because medication for rare conditions does not recoup the development cost, they do not get researched. This is a slippery slope fallacy because the author is implying that a single consequence (not recouping the development cost) leads inevitably to another consequence (not getting resear"

The Testimonial Fallacy occurs when an argument relies on the testimony of one or more individuals, but there is no way to verify the truth of their claims. In this case, the speaker claims that ""a bunch of other people walked too"" after they left, but there is no evidence or other sources to confirm this claim. The speaker's personal experience is used to make a generalization about the actions of other employees, which may not be accurate."

Explanation: The fallacy of False Dichotomy is committed when only two options are presented as the only possible alternatives, when in fact more options exist. In this case, the author suggests that the only two possible actions towards the trapped duck are ""helping"" or ""hunting"". However, there could be other possibilities such as the duck being left alone, the duck being rescued but not immediately, or the duck being rescued but the rescuer unintentionally harmed it in the process. The author oversimplifies the situation by presenting only two options, ""helping"" or ""hunting"", which is a false dichotomy."

Explanation:

Explanation:
The fallacy in both cases is the ""False Cause"" fallacy. The text is implying that because lobsters have hierarchies, humans should have them too (or that hierarchies are ""natural"" because they exist in the animal kingdom). However, the existence of hierarchies in lobsters does not necessarily mean that they are good or natural for humans. There are many factors to consider when determining whether a social structure is beneficial or not, and comparing human societies to lobsters oversimplifies the issue."

"TITLE: Yes, this is a poll about raiding and instances.
POST: There is a compromise: Popped bosses. You do a bunch of stuff/farming/crafting to assemble an item that will spawn the boss in the open world.

POST: I like this a lot, though I still would like to see a lockout timer for the party that spawns it.

The post suggests that a lockout timer is necessary because, as time goes on, raiding guilds will inevitably amass the necessary supplies and farm the boss. This implies that the existence of raiding guilds is a problem that needs to be addressed, which is a slippery slope fallacy. It assumes that because a negative outcome (griefing) might occur under certain conditions, those conditions are inevitable and the only solution is to restrict gameplay."

In this case, the fallacy of slippery slope is used. The author implies that the only two options are to return the item or negotiate a rebate, implying that there is a slippery slope of escalating consequences if the item is not returned. However, the author could have simply asked for a refund without suggesting that refusing to do so would lead to a slippery slope of issues."

Explanation: The author is suggesting that the reader should join another sorority because the first one rejected them, which implies that joining a different sorority is a popular or commonly accepted action (the ""bandwagon"").

Explanation:
The statement ""You taught 4 different grades per year??"" is a misrepresentation or exaggeration of the original statement, implying that the teacher taught all grades at the same time, which is not stated in the original post. This is a strawman fallacy because it misrepresents the original argument to make it easier to attack or refute. The original post only mentions that the teacher taught grades 4th to 12th at any given point in 4 years, not that they taught all grades simultaneously."

1.

The argument in this sentence suggests that if medical marijuana is allowed, it would give players in states where it is legal an unfair advantage, implying a ""slippery slope"" where allowing marijuana would lead to an uncontrollable chain of events (in this case, an unfair competitive advantage).

The post commits the slippery slope fallacy by suggesting that because humans are contributing to climate change and resource consumption, they can be considered an invasive species.

Explanation:

1. Appeal to Expertise (also known as Argumentum ad Verecundiam): The speaker suggests that the Trivium method is beneficial because it's recommended, implying that the method's value is based on the authority of the person who suggested it (Carl Sagan in this case).

2. Circular Argument: The speaker suggests that learning the Trivium method is beneficial because it helps one learn and research effectively, and then implies that learning about fallacies is also beneficial because it helps one learn and research effectively. This is a circular argument because the conclusion (learning about fallacies is beneficial) is based on the same premise (learning effectively) that the argument is trying to prove.

3. Circular Argument (again): The speaker suggests that learning the Trivium method is beneficial because it gives a great toolset for learning and researching effectively, and then implies that the Trivium method is a great toolset because it helps one learn and research effectively. This is a circular argument because the conclusion (the Trivium method is a great toolset) is based on the same premise (learning effectively) that the argument is trying to prove."

The author's statement that they are the author of the paper suggests that they are an expert on the topic, and therefore their argument should be considered more credible than others.

Explanation:

1. Oversimplification (also known as oversimplifying complex issues) is a fallacy that occurs when a complex issue or argument is reduced to a simpler, easy-to-understand form, often at the expense of accuracy or nuance. In this case, the author oversimplifies the design and purpose of the bar by stating that it should primarily resist downwards force, as that's how most people would use it. This oversimplifies the potential uses and design considerations of the bar.

2. Oversimplification is also used in the statement that the bar snapping when the person lands is not impossible odds, as it implies that the likelihood of this happening is based on a clear, easily understood set of factors, when in reality, the design, material, and usage of the bar could all play a role in its behavior."

POST: Apart from the moral issue, ""just join the military"" does nothing for young people with disabilities or conditions that disqualify them. And before some asshole says something like, ""Harhar just lose weight,"" there are waaaay more disqualifying issues than that and many are totally out of a person's control.

TITLE: What are the most cowardly things a person can do? POST: Refusing to acknowledge that you made a mistake and making excuses instead of being better. We're human. We're flawed - all of us.," [{""text"": ""Refusing to acknowledge that you made a mistake and making excuses instead of being better."", ""class"": ""Confirmation Bias""}]

Explanation: The text suggests that refusing to acknowledge a mistake and making excuses is cowardly, and that acknowledging a mistake is being better. This implies that there is only one correct way to respond to a mistake, and that anyone who doesn't respond in this way is being cowardly. This is an example of confirmation bias, which is the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs, and to reject any evidence that contradicts those beliefs. In this case, the author's belief that acknowledging a mistake is the correct response is being confirmed, and any other responses are being rejected as cowardly."
