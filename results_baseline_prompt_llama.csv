"TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE. I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses. Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a""creative"" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.
","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a'creative' mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love."", ""class"": ""Slippery Slope""}]

The fallacy is a Slippery Slope, which is the assumption that because a small initial step leads to a series of events, it will inevitably lead to a catastrophic or undesirable outcome. In this case, the author is arguing that if the game introduces an ""adventure mode"" or ""creative mode"", it will lead to a slippery slope of demands for easier modes, ultimately damaging the community's reputation.

Note that there might be other fallacies present, but the one mentioned above is the most prominent one."
"Two of my best friends are really introverted, shy people, and they both have cats. That leads to me believe that most cat lovers are really shy.
","After analyzing the text, I found that it contains the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""That leads to me believe that most cat lovers are really shy."", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The text commits a Hasty Generalization fallacy by concluding that most cat lovers are shy based on a very small sample size (only two friends) and a non-random selection of individuals (specifically, introverted and shy people). This is an unreliable way to make a general statement about a large population."
"TITLE: There is a difference between a'smurf' and an'alt'. Please learn it and stop using them interchangeably. POST: Someone once told me they have an""alt"" cause their main account was too high of rank to play with their friends. It's exactly the same as smurfing.
","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""It's exactly the same as smurfing."", ""class"": ""False Equivalence""}]

The text contains a false equivalence fallacy, where the author is trying to equate two concepts (smurfing and having an ""alt"" account) by saying they are the same, when in reality, they are not. Smurfing typically involves creating multiple accounts to gain an unfair advantage, whereas having an ""alt"" account might be done for various reasons, such as playing with friends or exploring a different gaming experience."

[{""text"": ""Like Jesus Christ you think they would learn."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}], 
[{""text"": ""The status quo in America is that its the best its ever been."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

The fallacies are:

1. Appeal to Unqualified Opinion: The statement ""NOBODY WANTS ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS ANYMORE. NOBODY LIKES THE STATUS QUO"" is an appeal to unqualified opinion, as it's making a general statement about what people want without providing evidence or qualifications.
2. Ad Hominem: The statement ""Like Jesus Christ you think they would learn"" is an ad hominem attack, as it's targeting the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.
3. False Dichotomy: The statement ""The status quo in America is that its the best its ever been"" presents a false dichotomy, as it implies that there are only two options: the status quo is the best it's ever been, or it's not. This oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and ignores the possibility of alternative perspectives."
"America is the best place to live, because it's better than any other country.
","The given text contains the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""America is the best place to live, because it's better than any other country."", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The text commits a False Dilemma fallacy by presenting a binary choice between America being the best place to live and not being the best place to live, when in reality, there are many other countries that could be considered the best place to live, and the comparison is not necessarily between America and all other countries."
"Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.
","After analyzing the text, I found one logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Fear""}]

The fallacy is an ""Appeal to Fear"" (also known as ""Argumentum ad Timorem""), where the speaker tries to persuade by creating a sense of fear or anxiety in the audience. In this case, the speaker is using the phrase ""the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen"" to create a sense of urgency and justify moving forward in every area."
"Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work. This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support. Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically.
","Here is the output:

[{""text"": ""Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Motive""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Motive, which is the attempt to discredit someone's argument by attacking their character or motivations, rather than addressing the argument itself. In this case, the text is trying to undermine Delores' credibility by labeling her an ""extremist"" and implying that her views are not worthy of consideration."
"""Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste. Therefore, it must be great.""
","The text contains the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste. Therefore, it must be great."", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The fallacy is ""Hasty Generalization"", which occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on a small sample size or a non-representative sample. In this case, the conclusion that ""it must be great"" is drawn based on the recommendation of four out of five dentists, which is a small sample size and may not be representative of the opinions of all dentists."

The text contains:

* Appeal to Ignorance: The author is dismissing the effectiveness of masks without providing any evidence or alternative solutions.
* Appeal to Emotion: The author is trying to persuade the reader by using emotional language, such as ""Cool it"" and ""get real"", rather than presenting logical arguments.
* Slippery Slope: The author is suggesting that if people start wearing masks, it will lead to an unreasonable demand for biohazard suits, without providing any evidence or considering the possibility that masks might be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19."
"The last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election. This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election.
","The given text contains the following fallacy:

[{""text"": ""This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election."", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The fallacy is a Hasty Generalization, as the conclusion is drawn based on a limited sample (the last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary) and is not supported by evidence or a thorough analysis."
"Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman.
","The given text contains the following fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman."", ""class"": ""hasty generalization""}]

The fallacy is a hasty generalization, which occurs when the conclusion is drawn from a limited or incomplete sample, and the conclusion is applied to the entire population. In this case, the conclusion is drawn from a general statement about men and women in math, and then applied to a specific individual, Jerry and Sylvia, without considering other factors that might affect their math abilities.

Note: There is no specific mention of a fallacy in the provided text, but it appears to be a hasty generalization."
"TITLE: Sign petition for Persona 5 pc and switch ports POST: So much important stuff in the world that needs political activism. Makes a petition to portbeg P5 onto PC and Switch.
","After analyzing the text, I found one logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""So much important stuff in the world that needs political activism."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Ignorance, as the text is dismissing the importance of porting Persona 5 to PC and Switch by claiming that there are more pressing issues in the world that need attention. This is an attempt to shift the focus away from the topic at hand and ignore the relevance of the petition."
"Carbon dioxide hurts nobody' s health. It' s good for plants. Climate change need not endanger anyone.
","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Carbon dioxide hurts nobody's health. It's good for plants."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

The text presents a dichotomy by implying that carbon dioxide can only have two effects: either it hurts nobody's health or it's good for plants. This is a false dichotomy because it oversimplifies the complex issue of climate change and ignores the potential negative impacts of carbon dioxide on health and the environment.

Additionally, I found another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""Climate change need not endanger anyone."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The text claims that climate change need not endanger anyone without providing evidence to support this claim. This is an appeal to ignorance, as it assumes that the absence of evidence proves the claim, without considering the potential consequences of climate change.

So, the output would be:

[{""text"": ""Carbon dioxide hurts nobody's health. It's good for plants."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}, {""text"": ""Climate change need not endanger anyone."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]"
"Mr. Governor issues a proclamation for the people of his state to pray for rain. Several months later, it rains. Praise the gods!
","[{""text"": ""Praise the gods!"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Emotion""}]

The text contains an Appeal to Emotion fallacy, as it is an attempt to persuade the audience to praise the gods based on a coincidence (it raining after the governor's proclamation) rather than providing a logical or evidence-based argument."
"Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program. They're more dangerous today than they were four years ago. North Korea has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons.

","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is an Ad Hominem, as the speaker is attacking the vice president's character (""an advocate for over a decade"") rather than addressing the issue at hand (lifting sanctions against Iran).

Note that there may be other fallacies present, but this is the one that stands out to me."

[{""text"": ""We just have to let it run its course."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Nature""}], [{""text"": ""You cant stop nature. Youre going to be infected if you havent already."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Nature""}]

The fallacies are:

1. Appeal to Nature: The speakers are suggesting that because nature is unstoppable, we should not try to stop the spread of the virus. This is an appeal to a higher power or a natural force, rather than a logical argument.
2. Appeal to Nature: The same argument is repeated in the second sentence, where the speaker is saying that we cannot stop nature and will always be infected. This is another appeal to nature, which is an attempt to justify a conclusion without providing a logical reason.

Note that there is also a mention of the lockdown in the first post, but it does not contain a logical fallacy."
"Jeff is preparing to create a commercial for a new energy drink. He visits a local high school and surveys students in an English class about their beverage preferences.

","After analyzing the text, I've identified the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""Jeff tells his superiors that grape is the flavor favored most by high school students."", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The fallacy is a Hasty Generalization, as Jeff is making a conclusion about the preferences of all high school students based on a small sample size (an English class) and without considering the possibility that the results may not be representative of the larger population."
"The Freehold Raceway Mall is the best mall because there are always so many cars there.
","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""The Freehold Raceway Mall is the best mall because there are always so many cars there."", ""class"": ""False Cause""}]

The fallacy is ""False Cause"" (also known as ""Post Hoc"" or ""Non Sequitur""), which occurs when the text claims that the presence of many cars at the mall is the reason why it is the best mall. The text does not provide any logical connection between the two statements, and the presence of many cars may not necessarily make the mall the best."

This is law school arrogance at its finest. Why not a brain surgeon?
","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""This is law school arrogance at its finest."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is an Ad Hominem, as the author is attacking the person (in this case, someone with a JD, MBA, and MSF) rather than addressing their argument or evidence. The phrase ""law school arrogance at its finest"" is a personal attack, attempting to discredit the person's opinion rather than engaging with the substance of their argument.

Note that there is no other fallacy detected in this text."
"The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin' s gain. Already the largest country on the planet, Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves, and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic. Along the Russian coastline, which makes up more than half the Arctic total, winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker, multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods.
","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin's gain."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Consequences, as the text assumes that the loss of sea ice will have a positive outcome (gain) for President Putin and Russia, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim. The text is making a value judgment based on the potential consequences of sea ice loss, rather than presenting a neutral or objective analysis of the issue.

"My first day of basketball practice was easy, so it will always be easy.

","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""I saw him trip another student and steal his lunch money!"", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is an Ad Hominem, which is a type of fallacy where an argument is rejected because of some irrelevant characteristic of the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. In this case, Jaylen is trying to discredit Brandon's argument by bringing up a personal characteristic (being a ""terrible person"") and a unrelated incident (tripping another student and stealing their lunch money), rather than addressing the argument itself (having tastier lunches)."

The fallacy is ""Affirmative Conclusion from Undistributed Middle"", also known as ""Undistributed Middle"". This fallacy occurs when the conclusion is drawn from a categorical syllogism, but the middle term is not distributed in both premises. In this case, the conclusion ""Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded"" is drawn from the premises ""Each of those psychologists is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded"" and ""They started a psychology training program"", but the middle term ""psychologists"" is not distributed in both premises."

The fallacy is ""Affirming the Consequent"", which occurs when someone concludes that a statement is always true based on the fact that it is true in a specific instance. In this case, the speaker is affirming that the phone will always be in the living room when it's lost, simply because it's true in this one instance (when the speaker lost their phone). This is a flawed argument, as there may be other instances where the phone is lost and not in the living room.

"TITLE: Bar in Thurles in trouble over ad featuring Jesus with a pint. Christians are slowly becoming bigger snowflakes than Muslims. POST: So was the bar burned by a mob and the owner killed? If not, Christians have a ways to go before they are on par with Muslims.
","After analyzing the text, I've identified the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Christians are slowly becoming bigger snowflakes than Muslims."", ""class"": ""False analogy""}]

The fallacy is a False analogy, which occurs when a comparison is made between two things that are not alike, in order to make a point. In this case, the author is comparing Christians to snowflakes, implying that they are becoming more fragile and easily offended, similar to snowflakes. However, this comparison is misleading and lacks any logical connection between the two concepts.

Note that there is no fallacy in the second sentence (""So was the bar burned by a mob and the owner killed? If not, Christians have a ways to go before they are on par with Muslims."") as it appears to be a rhetorical question, making a point about the perceived differences between Christian and Muslim reactions to similar situations."

[{""text"": ""So now the far left is going to have to admit that there is a difference between the brains of men and women and their behavior isn't just a social construct that is created by what toys they are raised with?"", ""class"": ""Strawman""}]

The fallacy is a Strawman, as the text misrepresents the opposing viewpoint by exaggerating or distorting it. The author assumes that the ""far left"" believes that gender differences are solely the result of social constructs and toys, when in reality, the opposing viewpoint might be more nuanced and complex.

Additionally, the text contains a hint of Ad Hominem, as it targets a political ideology (""the far left"") rather than addressing the scientific findings or arguments directly.

[{""text"": ""And even then they will be a minority, but at least it can sufficiently instigate some doubt."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}]

The text contains three logical fallacies:

1. False Dilemma: The author presents a dichotomy between ""a PhD is necessary to have an informed opinion"" and ""pro vaxxers don't have an informed opinion,"" implying that there are only two options. This fallacy occurs when a false choice is presented, and the author is trying to force a conclusion.
2. Appeal to Ignorance: The author suggests that antivaxxers need someone with a PhD to agree with their conclusion, implying that they are not capable of understanding the information themselves. This fallacy occurs when someone appeals to the lack of knowledge or understanding of others.
3. Appeal to Consequences: The author implies that even if someone with a PhD agrees with the antivaxxer's conclusion, it will only instigate doubt. This fallacy occurs when someone tries to manipulate others by emphasizing the potential negative consequences of a different opinion.

Note that these fallacies are not mutually exclusive, and the text may contain other fallacies as well."

","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

The text commits an Appeal to Authority fallacy by citing the support of 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, and many Republicans as evidence of the campaign's validity. This fallacy occurs when an argument relies on the authority or credentials of a person or group, rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning to support its claims.

The text contains a false cause fallacy, also known as a non sequitur. The rooster making a sound at sunrise is not the cause of the sun rising. The sun rising is a natural phenomenon that occurs due to the Earth's rotation and orbit around the sun, and the rooster's sound is an unrelated event."

","After analyzing the text, I identified the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Human are omnivores. End of argument."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The text commits an Appeal to Ignorance by assuming that the argument is ended simply because the fact that humans are omnivores is stated. This does not address the moral or practical implications of the vegan's refusal to live with someone who eats meat, and it ignores the possibility that there may be valid reasons for the vegan's stance.

[{""text"": ""If she doesnt want to live with meat eating, make a parenting plan in court and she can pay child support for the kid that lives with you fill time that she wont raise since meat is around."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The suggestion that the vegan should be forced to pay child support as a way to punish her for her refusal to live with someone who eats meat is an Ad Hominem attack, as it is a personal and emotional response rather than a logical or rational one.

","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""I dont have to justify it, vegans assume most people consider an animal life to be on par with human life, its not."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The author is dismissing the need to justify their position without providing evidence or logical reasoning, which is an appeal to ignorance. The author is also implying that vegans assume a certain moral equivalence between human and animal life, which is not necessarily the case, and using this assumption to justify their own position.

Additionally, I found:

[{""text"": ""There is nothing morally wrong about killing animals for food, you realise animals kill other animals for food too right?"", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The fallacy is ""False Cause"" (also known as ""Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc""), which occurs when the speaker assumes that because one event followed another, the first event must have caused the second.

Here's a brief explanation of each fallacy:

1. ""Appeal to Novelty"": The phrase ""This has got to be the strangest thing I have came across"" is an appeal to novelty, as it's trying to grab attention by emphasizing the unusualness of the story. This fallacy occurs because the speaker is focusing on the novelty of the situation rather than providing a balanced or evidence-based assessment.
2. ""Appeal to Ignorance"": The phrase ""Mostly likely a lie for attention"" is an appeal to ignorance, as it's assuming the story is false without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim. This fallacy occurs because the speaker is dismissing the story without considering alternative explanations or providing a more substantial argument.

This is a false dichotomy, as there are many other possible circumstances that don't fit into this binary choice.

The text contains a Slippery Slope Fallacy, where the author assumes that allowing the government to regulate hate speech will inevitably lead to the suppression of all forms of speech, including those that criticize Islam.

The text also contains two instances of False Dilemma, where the author presents a binary choice between allowing hate speech and losing all freedom of speech, and between criticizing Sharia laws and being persecuted by the government.

Finally, the text contains an Appeal to Fear, where the author warns the reader not to relinquish their freedoms willingly, implying that doing so will lead to dire consequences."

The fallacy is a Slippery Slope argument, which is a type of fallacious reasoning that occurs when someone argues that a proposed action will inevitably lead to a series of undesirable consequences, without providing any evidence to support this claim. In this case, the argument is that banning Hummers will inevitably lead to the government banning all cars, without providing any evidence to support this claim."

[{""text"": ""I now have a bad back and the only way I can get any sleep is to take 4 pain killers before bed or smoke one joint"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}]

The author is using an appeal to consequences, claiming that taking painkillers will lead to liver damage and make them ""useless"" in a few years, which is an exaggerated and unproven claim. This is an attempt to scare the reader into choosing cannabis as a solution, rather than presenting a balanced and evidence-based argument.

Additionally, there is a possible instance of:

[{""text"": ""I'll stick to what's natural"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Nature""}]

The author is implying that cannabis is ""natural"" and therefore better than painkillers, which is a fallacious appeal to nature. This is an attempt to sway the reader's opinion based on a subjective and emotive appeal, rather than presenting a logical and evidence-based argument.

[{""text"": ""This and banning plastic straws are the issues we need to solve to create a better life and society for people."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

The text commits a False Dichotomy by presenting foie gras ban and plastic straw ban as the only important issues that need to be solved to create a better life and society. This is an oversimplification, as there are many other pressing issues, such as homelessness and affordable housing crisis, that are not being addressed.

Additionally, the text also contains a hint of:

[{""text"": ""I'm so glad CA is at the forefront of tackling our nation's most pressing issues."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Emotion""}]

The text is using an appeal to ignorance, as it is implying that because the speaker's opponent may not agree with their point, it means that the opponent is not considering the facts. This is an informal fallacy, as it is not providing any evidence to support the claim that the country cannot morally and socially and economically accept an economy running out of time.

Additionally, the text contains:

[{""text"": ""Their solution to the inner city is more -- excuse the expression but it's true,""socialism.""', ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

Additionally, the text also contains:

[{""text"": ""POST: Animals are food for other animals, why they wouldn't be food for humans?"", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The text presents a false dichotomy by implying that the government is either smaller or the same, when in reality, it's possible to have a smaller government with a different composition of employees. The speaker is oversimplifying the situation and creating a false binary choice.

Additionally, I found another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""even though he says it's not"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Inconsistency""}]

The speaker is pointing out an inconsistency between what someone says and what is actually the case, in an attempt to discredit their argument. This is an appeal to inconsistency, as it's trying to undermine the person's credibility rather than addressing the argument itself.

[{""text"": ""B) There is nothing wrong with being racist or anti Semitic. Being tribal is a normal part of being human."", ""class"": ""False Equivalence""}]

Here's a brief explanation of each fallacy:

1. **Appeal to Motive**: In sentence A, the author is trying to discredit the opposition by implying that they're using hyperbole to deceive or manipulate. This is an appeal to motive, as the author is appealing to the reader's emotions and biases rather than addressing the argument itself.
2. **False Equivalence**: In sentence B, the author is equating being racist or anti-Semitic with being ""tribal,"" implying that these behaviors are morally equivalent. This is a false equivalence, as being tribal can be a natural and harmless aspect of human behavior, whereas racism and anti-Semitism are harmful and morally reprehensible. By equating the two, the author is downplaying the severity of racist and anti-Semitic behavior.

Note that there may be other fallacies present in the text, but these two are the most prominent and easily identifiable."

","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Almost 3k upvotes show that most people agree with me."", ""class"": ""Appeal to popularity""}]

The text contains an appeal to popularity, where the author assumes that because a large number of people agree with them (based on upvotes), their argument must be correct. This is a fallacious argument, as popularity does not necessarily equate to truth.

The first fallacy is an Appeal to Ignorance, where the author assumes that the study's findings are false without providing evidence or addressing the study's methodology. The author is ignoring the study's results and instead making a vague claim about average restaurants without providing any supporting evidence.

The second fallacy is a False Dichotomy, where the author presents a simplistic and inaccurate view of the issue. The author is implying that either fast food is responsible for the obesity epidemic, or food in general is responsible, without acknowledging that there may be multiple factors contributing to the problem.

Viewing porn also causes prolonged dopamine exposure, which the brain will build resistance against - making it more difficult to feel joy from other daily activities.

Additionally, I found:

[{""text"": ""the vast majority of people would want to know"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Popularity""}]

This fallacy is an ""Appeal to Popularity"" because it assumes that a majority opinion is inherently correct, without providing evidence to support this claim.

POST: I just picked up one of the tinted balms and it's a really lovely product. Nice tint, smooth, stays on.

[{""text"": ""POST: I just picked up one of the tinted balms and it's a really lovely product. Nice tint, smooth, stays on."", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The fallacy is a Hasty Generalization, as the speaker is making a general statement about the product (""it's a really lovely product"") based on a single experience (""I just picked up one of the tinted balms""). This is an incomplete and potentially misleading assessment, as there may be other experiences or perspectives that contradict this statement.

"TITLE: EXTRA! EXTRA!
POST: When Reddit can't get more unoriginal
POST: Have you not know that this poster is extremely popular in Oculus sub reddit? He creates those ""news"" papers every time there is some big news and people love it. Just look at the points in linked thread","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""Have you not know that this poster is extremely popular in Oculus sub reddit?"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

The fallacy is an ""Appeal to Authority"", as the author is trying to discredit the poster's argument by pointing out their popularity in the Oculus sub-reddit, rather than addressing the content of the argument itself.

Note that there may be other fallacies present, but this is the one I was able to identify. If you'd like me to review the text again, please let me know!"
"TITLE: G751JM. What the hell now? Please help. Is the laptop dead? Thank you, have a nice day
POST: Enter Bios and see if your hdd is detected. If it is, might be an issue with boot order. Else try this: <URL>
POST: Thanks, but what should I enter? Could you tell me step by step because I have no idea what you just said. Thanks for the help though","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""What the hell now?"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Emotion""}]

The phrase ""What the hell now?"" is an emotional expression of frustration, which is an appeal to emotion rather than a logical or rational inquiry. It's an attempt to elicit an emotional response from the reader rather than a thoughtful consideration of the issue.

Additionally, I found another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""Thanks for the help though"", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The phrase ""Thanks for the help though"" implies that the poster is grateful for the help offered, but the phrase ""though"" suggests that the help is not sufficient or complete. This creates a false dilemma, implying that the only options are either accepting the help or rejecting it, when in reality, there may be other options or alternatives available.

Note that these fallacies are minor and do not significantly impact the overall meaning or effectiveness of the text."
"TITLE: New Firefox Update

[{""text"": ""Since it looks like a dog and behaves like a cat."", ""class"": ""False analogy""}]

The text contains a False analogy, which is a type of fallacy where a comparison is made between two things that are not similar in order to make a point. In this case, the author is comparing a dog and a cat, but the comparison is not relevant to the topic of the Firefox update. The author is using this analogy to make a point about the update, but it is a flawed and misleading comparison."
"TITLE: Proof that Bots are manipulating the Rotten Tomatoes Audience score of The Last Jedi

[{""text"": ""Most people I spoke to didn't like TLJ, so if anything, it should have a lower than 55% score."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}], 
[{""text"": ""Every IRL person I know loves it, all the hate coming from the internet."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}], 
[{""text"": ""Anecdotal evidence works both ways"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}]

The fallacies are:

* Appeal to Consequences: The argument that the score should be lower because most people didn't like the movie is an appeal to consequences, as it tries to influence the outcome by emphasizing the negative consequences of a higher score.
* Appeal to Consequences: The statement that every IRL person loves the movie and the hate is coming from the internet is an appeal to consequences, as it tries to influence the outcome by emphasizing the positive consequences of a higher score.
* Appeal to Consequences: The phrase ""Anecdotal evidence works both ways"" is an appeal to consequences, as it tries to justify the anecdotal evidence by implying that it can be used to support either side of the argument.

Note that there may be other fallacies present in the text, but these are the ones that I was able to identify."

[{""text"": ""i think people focus too much on legendary acquisition and forgot how good the other parts of the xpac were."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

The text contains an Appeal to Nostalgia, where the author implies that their opinion is valid because it's based on nostalgia, rather than providing objective reasons. Additionally, the text contains two instances of False Dichotomy, where the author presents a simplistic and inaccurate view of the situation by implying that there were only two opposing opinions (in this case, people either loved or hated Legion) when in reality, there might have been more nuanced opinions."

[{""text"": ""I don't know, it's just a thing with me because I've been helping orphans for a long time and their mental health is seriously fucked up because of it."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}]

The text contains an Appeal to Consequences fallacy. The author is trying to justify their stance on dark humor by appealing to the consequences of not respecting the boundaries of others (in this case, not making fun of anyone's parents dying). The author is implying that not respecting these boundaries will lead to negative consequences (the mental health of orphans being ""seriously fucked up""). This is an attempt to manipulate the reader's emotions and justify their own behavior, rather than engaging in a logical argument."

POST: I got those tests and they came back fine, I was so confident that it was lupus for a while but that negative test has really thrown me !","After analyzing the text, I identified the following fallacies:

[{""text"": ""I'm not a doctor, but I have lupus. It sounds like lupus to me."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Personal Experience""}]

[{""text"": ""I got those tests and they came back fine, I was so confident that it was lupus for a while but that negative test has really thrown me!"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Emotion""}]

The first fallacy is an Appeal to Personal Experience, where the author, who is not a doctor, shares their personal experience with lupus to support their claim, rather than providing evidence or expert opinions.

The second fallacy is an Appeal to Emotion, where the author expresses their emotional reaction to the negative test result, trying to elicit an emotional response from the reader rather than presenting a logical argument.

Note that there might be other fallacies present, but these are the ones I could identify."

[{""text"": ""The whole situation wouldn't have happened if she didn't have easy access to a gun"", ""class"": ""False Cause""}]

The text contains a false cause fallacy, where the poster assumes that the situation would not have occurred if the woman did not have access to a gun. This is an oversimplification, as there may be other factors that contributed to the situation, and the availability of a gun is not the sole cause of the event."

POST: It isn't particularly relevant, but instinct magazine strictly covers LGBT stories, so for them it is. Also as a gay man, I get extra jollies from the intense irony of him being a gay trump supporter. Its not necessary for the story but it certainly enhances it.","After analyzing the text, I've identified the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""I get extra jollies from the intense irony of him being a gay trump supporter."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is an Ad Hominem, which occurs when the poster uses a personal attack or insult (in this case, the poster's enjoyment of the irony) to discredit the subject's argument or opinion, rather than addressing the argument itself.

Additionally, there's a subtle hint of the fallacy of Appeal to Consequences ([""text"": ""until he realizes there are consequences to his actions."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""]).

The fallacy of Appeal to Consequences occurs when someone's argument is based on the possibility of negative consequences, rather than the validity of the argument itself.

Note that these fallacies are subtle and might not be immediately apparent."

[{""text"": ""First we nearly lost Dr. Dre now we might lose Michael. This is getting progressively worse, I hope he pulls through. I'm sure he will tho"", ""class"": ""Slippery Slope""}]

The fallacy is a Slippery Slope, where the author is implying that if we ""nearly lost"" Dr. Dre, then it's only a matter of time before we lose someone else important, like Michael. This is a logical fallacy because it's an unjustified inference and an exaggeration.

And you have to keep one thing in mind, development of medications is brutally expensive. That leads to another problem.

I left after I was told to follow my subordinates to the bathroom to time their breaks in there, and one of my team was a pregnant woman.

[{""text"": ""No exaggeration, those are direct quotes."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]
[{""text"": ""No ragerts, yo."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

Note that the Ad Hominem fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making an argument instead of addressing the argument itself. In this case, the person making the argument is attacking the manager's character and behavior, rather than addressing the issue at hand.

The Appeal to Authority fallacy occurs when someone presents an argument as being true because of the authority or credibility of the person making it, rather than because of the argument itself. In this case, the person making the argument is presenting quotes from the highest management as evidence, rather than addressing the issue at hand.

The final Ad Hominem fallacy occurs when someone uses a colloquialism or slang term to attack or belittle someone or something, rather than addressing the issue at hand. In this case, the phrase ""No ragerts, yo"" is used to express disdain or annoyance towards the manager, rather than addressing the issue at hand."

[{""text"": ""6 is a bit too young, especially a game about killing people"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Consequences""}]

The fallacy is an ""Appeal to Consequences"", as the poster is implying that the game is too violent or mature for a 6-year-old based on the content of the game, rather than considering the child's individual maturity level or ability to understand the game's context.

If no other fallacies are present, the output would be:

[{""text"": ""They are backward like that."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}, {""text"": ""well, until it has more tx and more hashpower, not to mention higher price, bch does not prove a damn thing..."", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

The Ad Hominem fallacy occurs when the author attacks the person instead of addressing the argument. In this case, the author is dismissing Gregory Maxwell's opinion without providing a counterargument.

The False Dilemma fallacy occurs when someone presents only two options, implying that there are no other possibilities. In this case, the author is implying that Bitcoin Cash must have more transactions, hashpower, and a higher price to prove that the 1mb block size limit was wrong, which is a narrow and limited perspective."

* Appeal to anecdote: The statement ""Female sexual history obviously plays a big role in the success of marriage"" is an anecdotal claim that is not supported by evidence and is meant to persuade rather than inform.
* False dichotomy: The statistics presented are presented in a way that implies that there are only two options for women's sexual history (losing virginity as a teenager or waiting until age 18 or older, or having 0-5 premarital sexual partners or 6 or more), when in reality there may be many other factors at play."

The first fallacy is an Appeal to Consequences, where the argument is made that the NRA is committing terror by encouraging circumstances and laws that lead to 30,000 deaths a year. This is an appeal to emotions, rather than a logical argument.

The second fallacy is a False Dichotomy, where the argument is presented as if there are only two options: that all gun deaths are caused by illegal gun owners, or that all gun deaths are caused by legal gun owners. This is a false dichotomy because it ignores the possibility that gun deaths can be caused by a combination of factors, or that there are other options besides these two.

[{""text"": ""If a child rapist is sent to prison do you think I'm gonna care if someone does the same to them?"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Emotion""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Emotion, as the author is attempting to elicit an emotional response from the reader by using a provocative scenario to make a point about the treatment of prisoners.

Additionally, I found another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""Do they deserve it too?"", ""class"": ""Slippery Slope""}]

The fallacy is a Slippery Slope, as the author is implying that if we don't treat prisoners in a certain way, it will lead to a slippery slope of injustice and chaos. This is a fallacious argument, as it is an exaggerated and unfounded claim.

Instead, they're saying that the media and political parties are wrong, which is an appeal to ignorance.
2. **False Dichotomy**: The author is presenting a false choice by saying that politics is either ""extremely individualized"" or ""broad-strokes."" This is a false dichotomy because it implies that there are only two options, when in reality, politics can be complex and nuanced.
3. **Ad Hominem**: The author is attacking the credibility of leftists by saying they don't get along with them, which is an ad hominem attack. This is an attempt to discredit the opposing viewpoint by attacking the person rather than addressing the argument."

The fact is, Lars is responsible for some of the most memorable drum parts in metal (like the machine gun double bass part in One) and he is absolutely indispensable to the songwriting process with James. Lars, Kirk and even Cliff have all been criticized for their technical skills, but their creativity, along with James (who is an excellent songwriter and rhythm guitarist), was what made Metallica the greatest metal band of all time, not their chops.","Here is the output:

"TITLE: China like the interview,but who is Dr.Lobster?
POST: It's a reference to Peterson. He claimed that hierarchies are good because lobsters have hierarchies as well so it's natural.
POST: He claimed hierarchies are natural, since we can trace hierarchies to lobsters.","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""He claimed hierarchies are natural, since we can trace hierarchies to lobsters."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Nature""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Nature, which occurs when someone argues that because something is natural, it must be good or true. In this case, Dr. Peterson is using the existence of hierarchies in lobsters to justify the idea that hierarchies are natural and good in humans, without providing any additional evidence or reasoning.

Note that there might be other fallacies present, such as Ad Hominem (attacking Dr. Peterson's character) or False Dichotomy (presenting a false choice between two options), but based on the provided text, the Appeal to Nature fallacy is the most prominent one."

The fallacies are:

* ""Appeal to Consequences"" in the first post, where the user seems to justify the glitches in Max Payne by saying they loved it.
* ""False Dichotomy"" in the second post, where the user presents a binary choice between the story and gameplay, implying that the game is either great in one aspect or the other, without considering the possibility of a middle ground.
* ""Ad Hominem"" (informal fallacy) in the third post, where the user uses a playful tone to emphasize their point, but without providing a logical argument.
* ""Appeal to Novelty"" in the same post, where the user emphasizes the uniqueness of the flip-flop sandal physics, implying that it's a significant selling point without providing a logical justification.

Note that the last two instances are informal fallacies, which are not as formally recognized as the first two."

The fallacies are:

1. **Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person rather than addressing their argument. The responses are not addressing the original poster's concerns about political correctness and immigration policies, but instead resorting to personal attacks and name-calling.
2. **Ad Hominem** (again): The same fallacy is committed in the second response, where the person is accused of being a ""lazy bum"" and having a ""lazy"" attitude simply because they don't want to attend university.

[{""text"": ""We are citizens of the United States of America, and we must indeed unite together to stop this GOP cover-up."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

The text contains an appeal to authority, specifically an appeal to patriotism. The phrase ""We are citizens of the United States of America"" is an attempt to invoke a sense of shared identity and responsibility among the readers, in order to persuade them to support the demand that Bolton must testify. The phrase ""and we must indeed unite together"" is a call to action, implying that it is the duty of all citizens to stop the alleged ""GOP cover-up"".

Additionally, the text contains a subtle appeal to emotion, as the phrase ""stop this GOP cover-up"" is likely to elicit a strong emotional response from readers who are already invested in the political controversy surrounding Trump and Ukraine.

POST: I like this a lot, though I still would like to see a lockout timer for the party that spawns it. Only because, while the requirement may seem intense and unrepeatable when it's first discovered, inevitably raiding guilds will amass the supplies to farm the item, and thus the boss, and will need to be slowed down. But otherwise, I think this is a great way to let a group try the raid when they're ready on their own time, without being punished by raid guilds. :) Now, I never played FFXI; what are BCNMs?","After analyzing the text, I identified the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""I would like to see stuff like BCNMs from FFXI."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Unfamiliarity""}]

The poster is asking for something similar to BCNMs from FFXI, which is an appeal to unfamiliarity. The poster is assuming that the readers are familiar with BCNMs, but since the poster themselves are not, it's an appeal to the audience's lack of knowledge to justify their request.

Additionally, I found a possible:

[{""text"": ""but it's more limited"", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

The poster is implying that the compromise of popped bosses is either ""griefing is possible"" or ""griefing is not possible"", when in reality, there might be a middle ground or a spectrum of possibilities. The poster is presenting a false dichotomy by oversimplifying the situation.

If no other fallacies are present, the output would be:

[{""text"": ""Nothing much you can really do my friend apart from having the nail removed (which I did as mine were much worse that yours)."", ""class"": ""appeal to personal experience""}]

The fallacy is an appeal to personal experience, as the second poster is suggesting that their own experience with having their nails removed is a reliable basis for advising the original poster on their situation.

The fallacy is an Appeal to Consequences, as the author is trying to persuade the vendor to give a rebate by implying that if they don't, they will upgrade the screen themselves, which might not be a significant loss for the vendor. This is an attempt to manipulate the vendor's decision by highlighting the potential consequences of not granting the rebate.

The text contains an Ad Hominem fallacy, which is an attack on a person's character rather than addressing the argument. In this case, the author is correcting someone ""lol"" to avoid appearing spiteful, which is an attempt to discredit the other person's opinion rather than engaging with the argument.

[{""text"": ""POST: You taught 4 different grades per year??"", ""class"": ""Strawman""}]

The fallacy is a Strawman, as the response is misrepresenting or exaggerating the original statement to make it easier to attack. The original statement says that the teacher taught every grade from 4th to 12th at any given point in 4 years, which is a complex and nuanced statement. The response, however, simplistically asks if the teacher taught 4 different grades per year, which is not a direct challenge to the original statement."

[{""text"": ""POST: Every one I remember seeing has proven itself to be between 50% and 90% overstated."", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The fallacy is ""Hasty Generalization"" because the poster is generalizing that all Covid-related models have been between 50% and 90% overstated, based on their personal experience and memory. This is an oversimplification and may not be representative of all models, as they may have been accurate in some cases.

Additionally, I found a possible instance of the fallacy:

[{""text"": ""POST: One of the cities here went from three overflow hospitals to finding locations for one back in April, then only building a permanent one which has never been staffed."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is ""Ad Hominem"" because the poster is making an indirect attack on the city's administration or personnel, implying that they are incompetent or have ulterior motives for not staffing the hospital. This is a non-sequitur and does not address the issue at hand.

The fallacy is an Appeal to Consequences, specifically an appeal to the negative consequences of eating brioche bread.

The text contains three instances of logical fallacies:

1. **False analogy**: The author uses analogies to compare the situation with asking for a specific condiment at a deli or a pizza joint. However, these analogies are false because they don't accurately represent the situation. In the original context, Obama's preference for Dijon mustard is being criticized, while the analogies are used to deflect criticism.
2. **False analogy** (again): The author uses another analogy to compare the cost of Dijon mustard to a jar ($2) with its supposed ""fancy"" or ""special"" nature. This analogy is false because it's a flawed comparison. The cost of a product does not determine its perceived value or exclusivity.
3. **Ad hominem**: The author attacks Hannity's character by implying that he is trying to make Obama sound ""elite and fancy and out of touch"" for his preference. This is an ad hominem attack, as it focuses on Hannity's motives rather than addressing the issue at hand."

The post claims to have a negative opinion about Post Scriptum (PS) based on the ""vibe"" they got from watching gameplay, without actually playing the game themselves. This is an appeal to ignorance, as they are making a judgment about the game without having personal experience with it.

Additionally, I found another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""You havent played but are talking about it like this? Oof"", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

[{""text"": ""You're assuming your conclusion to be true in your premises, and the argument doesn't move in any direction."", ""class"": ""Circular Reasoning""}]

The text mentions Circular Reasoning, which is a fallacy where the conclusion is assumed in the premises, and the argument does not provide any new information or move in any direction.

Additionally, I identify another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""P1: Humans have moral value. (Conclusion assumed in premises.)"", ""class"": ""Tautology""}]

The text mentions that the premise ""P1: Humans have moral value"" assumes the conclusion in the premises, which is a characteristic of Tautology.

Note that the second response ""It's not circular at all because NTT doesn't revolve around proving human moral value"" is an attempt to defend against the Circular Reasoning fallacy, but it does not change the fact that the original argument is circular."

[{""text"": ""Awesome! Now make it say boobs."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ridicule""}]

The text contains an appeal to ridicule, where the second poster is attempting to be humorous and attention-grabbing by making a silly request. This fallacy is used to distract from the original topic of the calculator and to create a lighthearted atmosphere.

Additionally, I found a possible instance of:

[{""text"": ""The Russian word (*bufyer* or *boofer*) can mean both 'buffer' and 'boob'; the connection is via railroad buffers, the twin shock absorbers used to dampen the impact of a train car hitting a stop."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The provided explanation for the word ""bufyer"" or ""boofer"" being used in the context of both ""buffer"" and ""boob"" might be an attempt to justify or excuse the use of the word ""boob"" in a seemingly innocent way. This could be seen as an ad hominem attack, where the focus is shifted from the topic at hand (the calculator) to the person making the original request (the first poster).

However, it's worth noting that this second instance is more nuanced and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context and intentions of the poster."

Note that the first fallacy is a False Dilemma, as it presents a binary choice between allowing medical marijuana with a prescription and not allowing it at all, without considering other possibilities.

The second fallacy is a Slippery Slope, as it implies that if medical marijuana is allowed, it would lead to a series of undesirable consequences, without providing evidence to support this claim.

The third fallacy is an Appeal to Consequences, as it uses the fact that many companies in states where marijuana is legal do not allow its use as a reason to reject the idea of allowing medical marijuana in the NFL, without considering the merits of the issue."

The fallacy occurs when the poster assumes that the title ""Master of Magic : Master of No Magic"" implies a specific type of gameplay (warlord war trolls run) and expresses surprise or disappointment when it doesn't match their expectations.

The text is appealing to the consequences of not considering humans as an invasive species, rather than addressing the definition and the criteria for an invasive species.

The text also contains an ad hominem attack by implying that the person who put the 21-year-old on the sex offender registry is motivated by a desire to make their life ""shit"" simply because they are a ""horny teenager""."
"TITLE: [For Hire] Computer Science Grad.

POST: No not yet, have any recommendations?","Based on the provided text, I identified the following logical fallacy:

[{""text"": ""POST: No not yet, have any recommendations?"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Ignorance, as the person is asking for recommendations without having explored other options, such as talking to a local recruiter."
"TITLE: I looked it up the tweet does not lie the traitor did indeed take a fat one

[{""text"": ""let's not use homophobia as an insult, okay?"", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}], 
[{""text"": ""Dude its a porn parody about a homophobe"", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacies are:

1. ""Appeal to Authority"" - The phrase ""the tweet does not lie"" implies that the tweet is an authoritative source, which is not necessarily true.
2. ""Ad Hominem"" - The phrase ""the traitor did indeed take a fat one"" is an attack on the person's character, rather than addressing the argument.
3. ""False Dichotomy"" - The phrase ""let's not use homophobia as an insult, okay?"" implies that the only option is to use homophobia as an insult, which is not necessarily true.
4. ""Ad Hominem"" - The phrase ""Dude its a porn parody about a homophobe"" is an attack on the person's character, rather than addressing the argument.

[{""text"": ""this seems to be a general solution for microstuttering in certain pcs"", ""class"": ""Hasty Generalization""}]

The fallacy is ""Hasty Generalization"". The author claims that setting VRCompositor and VRServer priority to real time is a general solution for microstuttering, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The author may be relying on anecdotal evidence or a limited sample size, which is not representative of all situations.

"TITLE: Dolly's Braces
POST: [Nerdy girl with pigtails and braces is a common stereotype](<URL>). Dolly looks very similar to that stereotype, thus people get the details mixed up. That said, this is one of the best MEs around as it would fit really well together with Jaws, so it's weird that they didn't use braces in the movie.
POST: That's a pretty big ""thus"" you've thrown into the mix there. If this was just people getting details mixed up, the Mandela Effect would not sustain the interest it has.","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""That's a pretty big ""thus"" you've thrown into the mix there."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The first fallacy is a Non Sequitur, which is a type of logical fallacy where a conclusion is drawn from two or more premises that are not logically related.

The second fallacy is an Appeal to Ignorance, which is a type of logical fallacy where someone argues that a claim is true because it has not been proven false, or that a claim is false because it has not been proven true.

POST: Sagan doesn't really go into history as much as he talks about the history of pseudoscience. It is better to learn something like the [Trivium method](<URL>) before doing your own research. The Trivium method gives a great toolset for anybody to learn and research for themselves. It is also very helpful to learn about [fallacies](<URL>), as well.","After analyzing the text, I found the following logical fallacies:

[{""text"": ""It is better to learn something like the Trivium method before doing your own research."", ""class"": ""appeal to ignorance""}]

The fallacy is an ""appeal to ignorance"", as the poster suggests that one should learn the Trivium method before doing their own research, implying that without this method, research is not reliable or effective. This is a fallacious argument, as it assumes that the Trivium method is the only way to conduct reliable research, without providing evidence to support this claim.

Additionally, the following fallacy may also be present:

[{""text"": ""It is also very helpful to learn about [fallacies], as well."", ""class"": ""appeal to authority""}]

The fallacy is an ""appeal to authority"", as the poster implies that learning about fallacies is helpful without providing any evidence or explanation to support this claim. The audience is simply expected to accept this statement because the poster has stated it, without considering whether it is actually true or not."

[{""text"": ""Every time I find one that I like. I mention it to other people and then they feel the need to shit on whatever I'm watching and say I should watch something else because it's better."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is an Ad Hominem, as the original poster is attacking the opinions of others (""they feel the need to shit on"") rather than addressing the substance of the argument.

[{""text"": ""I dont think it depends on the plant."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Ignorance""}]

The fallacy is an Appeal to Ignorance, as the poster is dismissing the possibility that the plant food damage depends on the plant without providing any evidence or counterarguments to support their claim.

[{""text"": ""a lot of leftists are mad that its 1400 checks not 2000, because it was meant to supplement the 600 passed in december"", ""class"": ""False Dilemma""}]

Note that the first fallacy is an Appeal to Emotion, as the question ""Why are leftists STILL mad?"" is trying to elicit an emotional response rather than a logical one.

The second fallacy is a False Dilemma, as the text presents only two options (1400 checks or 2000 checks) and implies that the only possible reaction is to be mad, without considering other possible reactions or alternatives.

The fallacy is an Appeal to Authority, as the author is implying that their expertise as the author of the paper gives them credibility and authority to answer questions, rather than providing evidence to support their claims.

[{""text"": ""And after that, is political correctness killing your dog?"", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]
[{""text"": ""We scream, you decide."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Emotion""}]

The identified fallacies are:

* Appeal to Consequences: The argument that if Kavanaugh is innocent, he should demand an investigation by the FBI, and that the political win for Republicans would be a consequence of this, is an appeal to consequences. It assumes that the outcome of the investigation would be a political win for Republicans, rather than a genuine investigation.
* Appeal to Consequences: The argument that getting Dr. Ford in front of an FBI interrogator would be a huge political win for Republicans is another appeal to consequences.
* Ad Hominem: The phrase ""and after that, is political correctness killing your dog?"" is an ad hominem attack, as it is an attempt to discredit the opposing viewpoint by implying that it is motivated by a desire to be seen as caring about social justice (i.e. ""killing your dog"").
* Appeal to Emotion: The phrase ""We scream, you decide"" is an appeal to emotion, as it is an attempt to elicit an emotional response from the reader rather than a thoughtful consideration of the argument."

[{""text"": ""This isn't impossible odds at all."", ""class"": ""appeal to probability""}]

The fallacy is an ""appeal to probability"" because the author is implying that the event is not impossible because it makes sense in hindsight. This is a fallacious argument because it assumes that the event was probable without providing any evidence to support it.

Additionally, the text contains a minor fallacy:

[{""text"": ""Would've thought it was designed to resist downwards force more than lateral or upwards though as that's how most people would use it."", ""class"": ""false dichotomy""}]

The fallacy is a ""false dichotomy"" because the author presents a simplistic and inaccurate binary choice between ""downwards force"", ""lateral force"", and ""upwards force"". In reality, the design of the bar might have considered multiple forces and scenarios, not just a single or binary choice.

[{""text"": ""Not sure if Im interpreting what you are saying correctly Im using it as a point that the Postmodernist lens when critiquing literature doesnt include facts in their analysis."", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

The text contains two fallacies:

1. **Appeal to Consequences**: The author assumes that because some men use the idea that men are interested in things and women are interested in people as a way to minimize women's perspectives, the idea itself is invalid. This is an appeal to consequences, as the author is trying to discredit the idea by associating it with a negative outcome.
2. **False Dichotomy**: The author implies that Postmodernist criticism of literature is either fact-free or that it is the only approach that doesn't consider facts. This is a false dichotomy, as it presents a simplistic and inaccurate choice between two alternatives."

POST: So what would be the down side of this? I'm just curious if someone could tell me that would be great.
POST: The government has no right to spilt up your business","After analyzing the text, I've identified the following fallacies:

[{""text"": ""74% of voters also say they support the federal government breaking up large technology companies to reduce their power and increase competition and innovation"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Popularity""}]

The text appeals to popularity by citing the opinion of 74% of voters without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim. This fallacy assumes that the majority is always right, without considering other perspectives or potential flaws in the argument.

Additionally, I've found another fallacy:

[{""text"": ""The government has no right to spilt up your business"", ""class"": ""False Dichotomy""}]

This statement presents a false dichotomy by implying that the government's only options are to either not break up large technology companies or to break them up entirely. This oversimplifies the issue and ignores the possibility of alternative solutions or compromises."

[{""text"": ""I still don't think the whole QAnon thing was real. I think it was made up by trolls to see how much stupid shit they could get people to believe."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The fallacy is an Ad Hominem, as the author attacks the character of the people who believed in QAnon, calling them ""stupid"" and implying that they are gullible and easily manipulated. This is a fallacious argument, as it does not address the validity of the beliefs themselves, but instead focuses on attacking the character of those who hold them."

[{""text"": ""But every time I bring this point up, GOP_Fanboy just reverts to ""lol who are you to decide who gets paid what communist etc"""", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The first fallacy is an Ad Hominem, where the author is attacking the character of those who disagree with their argument, rather than addressing the argument itself.

The second fallacy is also an Ad Hominem, where the author is using name-calling and insults (""GOP_Fanboy"", ""communist"") to discredit their opponent, rather than engaging in a constructive discussion.

[{""text"": ""Would those just be 'normal' jobs, as compared to enlisting in the army?"", ""class"": ""No Fallacy""}]

The first fallacy is an Ad Hominem, which is an attack on a person's character rather than addressing their argument. The phrase ""some asshole"" is used to insult someone who might disagree with the original post, rather than engaging with their argument.

[{""text"": ""It takes a severe amount of head in the sand to think it can't happen to you."", ""class"": ""Ad Hominem""}]

The first fallacy is an Appeal to Ignorance, where the poster is implying that because something is unusual or unexpected, it must not be true. This is a fallacious argument because the truth of a statement is not determined by its novelty or rarity.

The second fallacy is an Ad Hominem, where the poster is attacking the person making the argument (in this case, the person who thinks it can't happen to New Zealand) rather than addressing the argument itself. This is a fallacious argument because it distracts from the issue at hand and tries to discredit the person making the argument rather than engaging with the substance of the argument.

Here's a brief explanation of each fallacy:

1. Ad Hominem: The phrase ""circle jerk with the right"" is an ad hominem attack, as it's an attempt to discredit the opposing view by attacking the person holding it, rather than addressing the argument itself.
2. False Dilemma: The statement ""if we go into politics, we should go with as little bias as possible and that's not what's happening here"" presents a false dilemma by implying that there are only two options: going into politics with bias or not going into politics at all. This ignores the possibility of going into politics with minimal bias or finding alternative approaches.

Note that these fallacies are not necessarily malicious or intentional, but rather a reflection of the natural human tendency to simplify complex issues and engage in emotional appeals."

The fallacy is an Appeal to Consequences, which is a type of fallacy where someone presents a conclusion as a consequence of an action, in this case, acknowledging mistakes and being better.
