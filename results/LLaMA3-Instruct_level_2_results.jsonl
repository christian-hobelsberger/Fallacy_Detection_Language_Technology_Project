This type of fallacy occurs when someone claims that a small initial step will inevitably lead to a much larger or more significant consequence, often with negative implications.\n\nIn this case, the author suggests that if an adventure mode were introduced, people would start playing at level 68 and then ask for level 90, and eventually, they would want a \"creative\" mode where they could access all items in the game without having to farm. The author implies that each step would logically follow from the previous one, leading down a slippery slope of increasing demands.\n\nThis fallacy is used to persuade others not to introduce an adventure mode because it might lead to more extreme demands. By presenting this hypothetical sequence of events as inevitable and undesirable, the author attempts to dissuade others from considering the introduction of such a feature."}, "then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses.": {"example_input": "TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE.
