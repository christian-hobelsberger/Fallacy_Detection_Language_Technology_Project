This is an exaggerated and oversimplified assumption about the potential consequences of the initial change.", "Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a\"creative\" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.": " The given sentence appears to be an instance of \"slippery slope\" fallacy. In this case, the argument is suggesting that if one change (e.g., introducing an adventure mode) leads to another (requesting creative mode), and so forth, it will result in a negative outcome. However, the connection between these changes might not necessarily be logical or direct, making the argument fallacious."}}
