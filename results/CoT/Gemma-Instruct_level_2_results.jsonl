POST: Social media is the worst. People don't realize how much of an effect it has on someone, especially his generation. Anyone in the public eye who has any sort of mental health issue should rid themselves of their accounts if they possibly can. I understand studios force some actors to be active there, but if it's the difference between leading a happy, healthy life or getting a movie role, it really should be an easy decision. POST: Really, the worst? China has people in internment camps and people in the middle east get stoned for not wearing head scarves, but it's social media that's the worst? I think that's a massive exaggeration. Edit: I feel like I need to clarify that I'm not trying to deny what Pete is going through.
