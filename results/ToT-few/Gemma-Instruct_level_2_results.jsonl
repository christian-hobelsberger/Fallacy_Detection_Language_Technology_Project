(If A then B) in this sentence: If one specific Spider bite is poisonous , Then all Spiders are Poisonous\n\n\n* *Note:* Conditional statements can be helpful tools for understanding relationships between events, but they only hold true under certain conditions. \n**Step3 - Consider the Context:**\n\n   - The premise states that a single instance of spider bit was venomous (the specific one responsible). But this doesn't automatically mean all spiders are poisonous or bite with venom\n\n\n* *Note:* Drawing conclusions about an entire group based on behavior observed in  a limited sample is prone to error. \n**Step4 - Conclusion:**\n\n   Therefore, the sentence \"The spider that bit was poison therefore ,all Spiders arw poisons\" contains a hasty generalization and does not provide sufficient evidence or data from other bites of different spiders as supporting facts for concluding all Spider are poisonous"}}}
