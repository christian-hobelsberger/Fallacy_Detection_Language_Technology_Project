The title, \"Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts,\" suggests that there is a campaign or movement advocating for an \"Endless Ledge Skip\" feature and the use of alternate characters (alts) in Path of Exile (PoE).\n    2. In the post, the author mentions that reading comments from others has influenced their opinion on including an adventure mode-like feature in PoE. The exact meaning of this adventure mode is not specified but seems to involve leveling up a character beyond 68, skipping content, and accessing various game elements (possibly bosses).\n\n     Sentence: \"I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses. Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a 'creative' mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm.\"\n     Answer:\n    1. The author expresses concerns about an apparent trend that if there is an adventure mode, players will start their characters at higher levels (68 and 90), bypassing content, and then ask for even more features like a 'creative' mode with access to all items in the game to avoid farming.\n    2. The author seems to express worries about setting a precedent that could lead to players asking for increasingly easier ways to progress through the game, potentially undermining the challenge and depth of the game."}, "I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68.": {"example_input": "TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE.
