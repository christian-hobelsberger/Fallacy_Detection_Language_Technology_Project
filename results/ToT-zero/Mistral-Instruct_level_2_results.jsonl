The title of the post, \"Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts,\" refers to a proposed feature or campaign within the game Path of Exile (PoE) that allows players to bypass certain levels and progress more quickly using a technique called endless ledge skipping and on alternative characters (alts).\n    2. The post's main statement is about the writer having changed their opinion on the inclusion of an adventure-like mode in PoE based on reading comments from other players.\n\nSentence: \"I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68.\"\n\n    1. The writer expresses a common sentiment that they perceive among players, stating they often see requests for starting characters at level 68 or higher (instead of the traditional level 1) in the context of an adventure mode.\n\nSentence: \"then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses.\"\n\n    1. The writer implies that, if an adventure mode allows players to bypass levels quickly, some players might eventually request starting characters at level 90 (or higher) in order to engage with endgame content more efficiently, such as killing bosses.\n\nSentence: \"Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a 'creative' mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.\"\n\n    1. The writer speculates further, stating that, if an adventure-like mode grants access to all items, players may eventually request a \"creative\" mode with unlimited resources to avoid farming. They express concern about this development, suggesting it might not set a positive example for the PoE community and potentially undermine the enjoyment of the game for those who value its challenges and mechanics.\n    2. The writer's primary concern appears to be that players may gradually push for easier or more streamlined modes of play, which could negatively impact the overall experience of the game and set a poor example for the community."}, "I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68.": {"example_input": "TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE.

Additionally, there's a potential slippery slope fallacy in this sentence, as the speaker seems to suggest that if the game were to introduce an adventure mode and later a creative mode, players would become lazy and rely on these modes rather than actively playing the game.
