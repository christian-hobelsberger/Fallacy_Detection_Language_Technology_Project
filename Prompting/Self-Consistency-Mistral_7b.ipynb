It has been shown to make men more sexually aggressive, dissatisfied with their own sex lives, and contributes to the global sex trade. Viewing porn also causes prolonged dopamine exposure, which the brain will build resistance against - making it more difficult to feel joy from other daily activities. Porn is also highly addictive, and has diminishing returns over time, so a user will have to watch more porn, or more extreme porn, to get the same amount of dopamine.

They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval.

No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit.

I want to enjoy a shooter with team work and strategy on a large scale. I like the relatively fast paced gameplay, less down time, more engagements, smaller maps and leathal weapons make for epic flanks, as a result i feel like as a single player i can have a decent impact on a game - i just enjoy the pacing and the way combat plays out (im nervous that the infantry vehicles will fuck this up). I'll admit that PS's wider range of factions does look very attractive but at the end of the day whats the point in having all these unique and interesting guns and what not when for most of the game you arent going to be using them because your going to be on the move and then when you do its spamming suppressing fire at a hedge.
