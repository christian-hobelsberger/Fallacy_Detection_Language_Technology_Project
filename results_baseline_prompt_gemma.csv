I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses.

However, this conclusion is not necessarily valid, as it does not consider the possibility that other cat lovers may not be shy."

**Explanation:**

The text contains two logical fallacies:

* **Appeal to History:** The author assumes that the Democratic party will lose the 2020 presidential election because of Hillary Clinton's failure in 2016. This is a fallacy because it does not consider the fact that there are many factors that could influence the outcome of the election, such as the candidate's popularity, the state of the economy, and the overall political climate.
* **Appeal to Emotion:** The author appeals to emotion by saying that nobody wants establishment politicians or the status quo. This is also a fallacy because it does not consider the fact that some people may actually prefer these things."

This text contains an appeal to authority fallacy. The author claims that the leaders of the world are ruthless and fanatical, and therefore America must move forward in every area.

","[{""text"": ""Trump's plan to improve healthcare, that everyone said wouldn't work, is already working"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

**Explanation:**

The text contains an appeal to authority fallacy. This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the authority of a person or organization to support their argument, without providing any evidence to support the argument themselves. In this case, the author is relying on the authority of the statement ""everyone said"" to support their claim that Trump's plan is not working. However, this statement is not necessarily true. There is no evidence to support the claim that everyone agrees that Trump's plan is not working."

**Explanation:**

The text contains two logical fallacies:

* **Appeal to Nature:** This fallacy occurs when someone uses the appeal to nature to justify an action, without considering the potential negative consequences of that action. In this case, the poster is appealing to the naturalness of hunting to justify it, but they do not consider the negative impacts that hunting can have on the environment and wildlife.
* **Appeal to Authority:** This fallacy occurs when someone cites the authority of a person or group to support their argument. In this case, the poster is citing the fact that their ancestors used to hunt to justify their own hunting, but they do not consider the fact that their ancestors lived in a very different world than we do today."

**Explanation:**

The text contains two logical fallacies:

POST: Wouldn't it be the other way around? Since it looks like a dog and behaves like a cat.

**Fallacies:**

[{""text"": ""Wouldn't it be the other way around? Since it looks like a dog and behaves like a cat."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

**Explanation:**

The text contains an appeal to authority fallacy. The author cites the appearance and behavior of the object as evidence that it is a dog, therefore it should be treated like a dog. However, this is not necessarily true. The object may look like a dog, but it may not behave like one."
"TITLE: Proof that Bots are manipulating the Rotten Tomatoes Audience score of The Last Jedi
POST: Doesn't prove anything. Could just be an error. Most people I spoke to didn't like TLJ, so if anything, it should have a lower than 55% score.
POST: Every IRL person I know loves it, all the hate coming from the internet. Anecdotal evidence works both ways","[{""text"": ""Every IRL person I know loves it, all the hate coming from the internet."", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

This text contains an appeal to authority fallacy. The author relies on the authority of their own anecdotal evidence to support their claim that the movie is loved by all IRL people. However, this is not a valid form of evidence, as it does not represent the opinions of a large enough sample of people."
"TITLE: Legion is the best overall expac we will ever get and here is why
POST: This feels like definite nostalgia talking to me. Off the top of my head legiondaries were pretty bad bc it took so long to be able to target them. I remember getting the one I wanted for a character about a week before BFA dropped and not really being able to use it. Also was never really a fan of the AP grind tho I did love having my weapon always guaranteed. Order halls were also super hit or miss for me and I hated the rogue one. Spent most of my time in the Maelstrom and I liked it tho.
POST: i think people focus too much on legendary acquisition and forgot how good the other parts of the xpac were. there werent many complaints at all except for legendary acquisition","[{""text"": ""I remember getting the one I wanted for a character about a week before BFA dropped and not really being able to use it."", ""class"": ""Availability Fallacy""}]

This text contains an availability fallacy. The author is biased towards the fact that they were unable to use their desired legendary weapon immediately, and therefore overstates the inconvenience of the weapon's availability."
"TITLE: People who are into dark humor, where do you draw the line?
POST: I don't make fun of anyone's parents dying. I don't know, it's just a thing with me because I've been helping orphans for a long time and their mental health is seriously fucked up because of it.

This text contains an appeal to pity fallacy. The author is trying to gain sympathy by talking about the mental health of orphans."
"TITLE: Doctors have dismissed my symptoms, but I promise I'm not crazy
POST: I'm not a doctor, but I have lupus. It sounds like lupus to me. Did you get ANA and ENA tests? I had to beg for them and then the doctors were all miffed because I proved I was sick. Good luck.
POST: I got those tests and they came back fine, I was so confident that it was lupus for a while but that negative test has really thrown me !","[{""text"": ""Did you get ANA and ENA tests?

"TITLE: Armed Citizen Shoots, Kills Active Shooter At Tulsa Shopping Center.
POST: So a woman got in an altercation, got mad and grabbed a gun and starting shooting, and was then shot by someone else.
POST: The whole situation wouldn't have happened if she didnt have easy access to a gun","[{""text"": ""The whole situation wouldn't have happened if she didnt have easy access to a gun"", ""class"": ""Post hoc fallacy""}]

The text contains a post hoc fallacy. The post hoc fallacy is a fallacy that assumes that because B happened after A, then A caused B. In this text, the assumption is that the woman's altercation and shooting would not have occurred if she did not have easy access to a gun. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. There could be many other factors that contributed to the occurrence of the shooting, such as the woman's mental state or her access to other weapons."
"TITLE: Gay trump supporter talks real big about his experience storming the capitol until he realizes there are consequences to his actions.
POST: I get that it's weird that someone from the lgbtq+community supports fascists who want people like him to die, but I don't see his sexual identity having any relevance to this story.
POST: It isn't particularly relevant, but instinct magazine strictly covers LGBT stories, so for them it is. Also as a gay man, I get extra jollies from the intense irony of him being a gay trump supporter.

**Explanation:**

* **Appeal to emotion:** The author appeals to the reader's emotions by stating that it is weird that a gay person supports fascists. This is an attempt to evoke negative emotions such as anger and disgust.
* **Straw man:** The author misrepresents the position of the second post by claiming that the author believes that his sexual identity is not relevant to the story. This is not true. The author states that his sexual identity is relevant to the story because he gets extra jollies from the irony of the situation."
"TITLE: Ned, the actor behind Micheal, was recently admitted in the hospital for Covid Pneumonia, hoping for his good health and be well soon

"TITLE: Why is there so much turmoil towards the pharmaceutical industry among the general public ? And do professionals in this field feel the same way about the field ?
POST: It's an industry like any other. The outrage is mostly aimed at outrageous pricing for their products *in America*. That's not the fault of that industry at the core, it's the fault of a political system allowing it. We don't suffer from that where I live, and we get our medicine from the same industry. And you have to keep one thing in mind, development of medications is brutally expensive. That leads to another problem. The industry wants to make profit, and consequently directs their efforts at products that will sell well. Medication for rare conditions will never recoup the development cost and consequently don't get researched. That's another systemic problem.

The industry wants to make profit, and consequently directs their efforts at products that will sell well."", ""class"": ""Straw Man""}]

The text contains two logical fallacies. The first fallacy is an appeal to authority, which is made when someone cites the authority of a person or organization to support their argument. In this case, the author cites the authority of the pharmaceutical industry to support their argument that the outrage is mostly aimed at outrageous pricing for their products in America. The second fallacy is a straw man fallacy, which is made when someone misrepresents the argument of their opponent in order to make it easier to defeat. In this case, the author misrepresents the argument of their opponent by claiming that the industry wants to make profit at the expense of rare conditions."
"TITLE: What was your 'I don't get paid enough for this' moment at work?
POST: My boss insisted that everybody be at their desks at 8:30 sharp. She made me take roll on an attendance sheet and hand it into her everyday. She also made me do it at lunch time (when everybody left and came back) and when they left at night. Took roll for a bunch of adults three times a day. I don't work there anymore.
POST: Oh man, I'm actually relieved, because I had to do this same shit to my subordinates, and honestly I made up numbers 99% of the time because they worked their full hours and could prove it, and their performance was the best in the office because they weren't being crushed by an asshole dictator. I left after I was told to follow my subordinates to the bathroom to time their breaks in there, and one of my team was a pregnant woman. When I objected, I was told by the highest management that I was immature, not a team player, and I had to do exactly everything I was told, no questions asked. No exaggeration, those are direct quotes. I made sure my folks were covered and handed in my resignation. After I left, my friends there told me that a bunch of other people walked too. It was a great place to work for my first two years, but the manager had never held that position, was stubborn, and hated millennials, and so went out of her way to be horrible to her own staff. No ragerts, yo.","[{""text"": ""Took roll for a bunch of adults three times a day.

POST: No. They were being hunted. Please take this down u/the_ebb_and_flow","[{""text"": ""No. They were being hunted. Please take this down u/the_ebb_and_flow"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

The text contains an appeal to authority fallacy. The poster cites the authority of another poster (""u/the_ebb_and_flow"") to support their claim that the duck was being hunted. However, this appeal to authority is not valid because the other poster does not provide any evidence to support their claim."

POST: I think it's more of a practical thing, rather than a preference. A brand new tire is dark black and matte. Yes, that does look great. However after getting some sun a tire turns grey'ish and kind of chalky. It's just cheap and readily available to grab some tire shine and quickly make them dark black and shiny!

"TITLE: CMV: The NRA is a terrorist organization, and it would be legal under the Insurrection act for the US to take military action against it
POST: No. The NRA does not use terror to stop common sense laws that would stop those deaths. Background checks are common sense, assault weapon bans are not. With the amount of weapons in the USA and the ease of smuggling in the country assault weapon bans wouldn't do anything because you could still get then illegally. The majority of gun deaths don't happen because someone who legally owns a gun does something illegal. The majority of deaths happen because someone who illegally owns a gun does something illegal. Restrictions on acquisitions are not going to stop that. Enforcement of possession laws will stop that and no politician is campaigning to do that. Even though the NRA would presumably be fine with it.
POST: The NRA commits terror by encouraging circumstances and laws which lead to 30,000 deaths a year The majority of gun deaths are carried out by legal gun owners with no criminal records. 20,000 of the 30,000 gun deaths are caused by legal owners who have never been arrested.","[{""text"": ""The NRA is a terrorist organization, and it would be legal under the Insurrection act for the US to take military action against it"", ""class"": ""Ad hominem""}]

The text claims that the NRA is a terrorist organization and that it would be legal under the Insurrection Act for the US to take military action against it. This text uses the ad hominem fallacy, which attacks the character of the person making the argument rather than the argument itself."

POST: It is fair to say that Lars, in the grand scheme of heavy metal drummers, ranks lower when it comes to technical skills, especially compared to the likes of Lombardo or Menza, and his drumming has only gotten lazier and sloppier with time. However, the drumming on the first four albums, especially AFJA, was pretty solid. The fact is, Lars is responsible for some of the most memorable drum parts in metal (like the machine gun double bass part in One) and he is absolutely indispensable to the songwriting process with James. Lars, Kirk and even Cliff have all been criticized for their technical skills, but their creativity, along with James (who is an excellent songwriter and rhythm guitarist), was what made Metallica the greatest metal band of all time, not their chops.","[{""text"": ""If a successful band in any genre was based only on the very best technical players there would only be a handful of bands out there to listen to right?"", ""class"": ""Appeal to Authority""}]

"TITLE: In mid-December, a model from the CA government predicted 75K COVID hospitalizations by mid-January, steep growth from the 16K then hospitalized. Yesterday, CA had less than 21K COVID hospitalizations.
POST: In all honesty have we seen one single Covid related model turn out to be correct or even close in the past 10 months?

They claim they don't have the personnel to staff them....despite the state's NG being given authorization from our governor to send its stock of nurses and doctors to do it.

**Explanation:**

* **Appeal to Authority:** The text cites the opinion of an unspecified number of people (""every one I remember seeing"") as evidence to support the claim that models are overstated by 50-90%. This is an appeal to authority fallacy because it relies on the opinions of others without providing any evidence to support those opinions.
* **Red Herring:** The text mentions the fact that one city went from having three overflow hospitals to finding locations for one back in April. This is a red herring because it is not relevant to the main point of the text, which is about the inaccuracy of COVID-19 models."

**Explanation:**

* **Appeal to analogy:** The author compares the situation of someone asking for marinara at a pizza joint to the situation of someone asking for dijon mustard at a deli. This comparison is not appropriate, as the two situations are not similar.
